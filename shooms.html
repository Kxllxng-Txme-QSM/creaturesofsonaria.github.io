    <center><h2>Getting shooms (also commonly referred to as mush or mushrooms) is simple, while in-game you get five shooms per every two minutes your creature is alive. You also get a daily bonus, on the first day you get ten shooms then +10 for every day after. You can get tokens, which can be applied to your creatures, and on the final day you get an Ikoran which was one of the first reatures released in the game. You can also go into the trading hub and trade creatures for shooms [see - Trading] but make sure you sell them at a good price!</h2></center>
