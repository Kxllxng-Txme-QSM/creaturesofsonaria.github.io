    <center><h2>Trading is harder than it seems, but can be mastered easily! Going into the trading hub with just a starter creature will get you nowhere, everyone already has it. You should try to find easy-to-get popular creatures, like the Minawii and Momola. They can both be aquired in the gachas. Creatures can be sold for mush or for other creatures, but some are worth way more than others. For example; a Minawii is worth about 25-50 shooms, where as a Jotunhel (commonly known at the Jot) is worth at least 5-8 thousand shooms. The Saukuryn is a good creature to trade, as it is well-sized and can even take on the game's most dangerous creature; the Jot [See - Events].</h2></center>
