    <center><h2>You get creatures from the gachas, or from secret missions. To get to the gachas, you click 'buy creatures' at the bottom of the home screen. The starter gacha is 35 shooms, which is easy to get [See - Getting Shooms]. There are 10 regular gachas in total, and there are occasionally special gachas during events [See - Events]. There is the normal gacha (holding all creatures, but with a 1.49% chance for each creature), carnivore gacha (meat eaters), herbivore gacha (plants eaters), omnivore gacha (plants and meat eaters), sky gacha (flying creatures), sea gacha (swimming creatures), semi-aquatic gacha (walkers and swimmers), toxic gacha (creatures with toxic abilities), bleeder gacha (creatures that inflict extrea damage), and limited gacha (overall great creatures).</h2></center>
